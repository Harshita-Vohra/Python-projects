# Python-Projects
This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate cybersecurity focused programs. These projects demonstrate encryption, cipher useages, brute force attacking, and chatbot simulations.

## Projects Included

## 1. Breach Bot ##
A chatbot that guides users through a real life cybersecurity breach using if/else commands along with while loops to simulate interaction and show what happened. 

## 2. Cipher Usablility ##
Makes ciphered text easier to use. It employs pre-defined libraries to build encryption logic that is adaptable.

## 3. Cracking Caesar's Cipher ##
Decrypts Caesar ciphers by displaying all possible results through brute force.

## 4. Programing Caesar's Cipher ##
Encrypts and decrpyts messages using the Caesar shift method with uppercase letters only (A-Z). 

## 5. CyHelp ##
An introduction to cybersecurity concepts. This python project is what established key ideas in an approachable way.
